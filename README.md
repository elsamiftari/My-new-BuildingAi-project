# StudyCompanionAI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

StudyCompanionAI is a smart assistant for students that helps manage academic tasks using automation and AI. It reminds about deadlines, tracks grades, and visualizes progress in an easy-to-understand way.

## Background

Students often struggle with managing multiple courses, tracking progress, and remembering deadlines. This project helps to solve these common issues in a modern study environment.

My motivation came from personal experience—balancing tasks and studies is difficult, and I wanted to create something practical and useful.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* Missed deadlines
* Poor visibility into study progress
* Lack of motivation due to disorganized tasks

## How is it used?

The student activates the robot, which automatically:
* collects course info (e.g., grades, assignments),
* stores it in structured format (Excel, database),
* reminds about deadlines via desktop/mobile notifications,
* visualizes progress in a dashboard (e.g., Power BI or Excel graphs).

Typical use cases:
* Weekly check-ins to track academic progress
* Reminders before assignment due dates
* Motivation boost via clear visuals

## Data sources and AI methods

The data is collected from study portals (e.g., Canvas, Pakki) using:
* Power Automate Desktop flows
* Excel as storage medium
* Optional use of GPT or other AI tools to analyze performance

| Tool/Source | Purpose |
| ----------- | ------- |
| Power Automate Desktop | Automation |
| Excel | Data storage |
| Power BI | Visualization |
| GPT (optional) | Smart suggestions |

## Challenges

The project does not:
* Integrate with every platform out-of-the-box
* Analyze qualitative feedback (e.g., from open comments)
* Provide real-time mobile apps

Ethical considerations:
* User privacy and secure handling of grade data
* Avoiding overdependence on automation

## What next?

Future improvements could include:
* Integration with calendars and email
* Natural language interface (chatbot/voice assistant)
* Machine learning to predict learning gaps

To move forward, I would need:
* Better access to APIs from learning platforms
* Feedback from students and teachers
* More experience with secure data handling
